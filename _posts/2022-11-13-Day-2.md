Started off the day with some C programming. Well, technically, it was more reading code and trying to understand it than actually writing it.
Watched three more videos from CrashCourse: Computer Science which were on Boolean logic, Binary representation and how the computers calculate, which dove into the inner workings of the Arithmetic and Logic Unit(ALU).
I found the simplicity of the underlying abstractions breathtaking.
Not realated to coding per se, but I decided to pick up a book on writing in hopes of fixing my subpar writing. Fingers crossed.
